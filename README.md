# Desire-for-Python
This repository consist of some mini projects that I have created using Python language. Let's learn to code whilst having fun.

To add ascii figure -

1. Type print('''
              ''')

2. Search an ascii art of doors (or treasure) in google.

3. Copy and paste the art inside the print function.
